# SoftTeco Test Task

Hello **reviewer** and everyone else!
It was interesting and amazing! :)

But I didn't have enough time to do some things:

- database (in the [backend project](https://github.com/superpuper777/currency-converter-backend) (db branch) you can see the creation of a database based on the data received from the API)

- working with local storage

- creating a table/list

_In some places in the code, I wanted to show my way of thinking with commented code_

**Thank you for your attention!**

### Development:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci install`

### `npm start`

### Deployment:

[DEPLOYLINK](https://currency-zone-smiu.onrender.com)

## ATTENTION! Unfortunately, there is a limit on requests per server (~187 used / 300 available)
